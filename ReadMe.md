In this project, I am making Text generation model using simple LSTM model, trained on Gutenberg ebook ,named The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur Conan Doyle.

I got accuracy of 89% by training the LSTM model. It is character level model.

I have also generated text using GPT2 model of HuggingFace. It is word level model.
